# Payment System Changes

## Summary
Implemented a Razorpay payment system similar to the one in shikhar-main.py. This allows users to upgrade to premium status through a payment gateway.

## Changes Made

### New Files
- `payment.html`: Custom HTML page for Razorpay payments
- `env_example.txt`: Example environment variables file including Razorpay configuration
- `razorpay-payment.html`: Direct HTML payment page for Razorpay based on shikhar's implementation

### Database Updates
- Added `Transaction` table in `db_storage.py`
- Added transaction-related functions:
  - `save_transaction()`: Stores transaction details in the database
  - `get_transaction_by_id()`: Retrieves transaction information

### Main Application Changes
- Added payment success query parameter handling in `main.py`
- Added payment status tracking in session state
- Added direct payment button in the sidebar
- Added multiple payment options:
  - Payment page toggle in sidebar
  - Direct ngrok URL link to payment.html
  - HTML payment button using 127.0.0.1:5500
  - Direct Razorpay payment button with exact URL from shikhar's implementation
- Updated README.md with payment system setup instructions

### Razorpay Integration
- Added `render_payment_html()` function to inject environment variables into the payment HTML template
- Updated the payment interface with multiple payment options
- Implemented redirect handling for successful payments

## How to Test
1. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file based on `env_example.txt`
2. Start the application with `streamlit run main.py`
3. Test the payment flow by clicking either:
   - "Upgrade to Premium" button in the sidebar
   - "Direct Payment" button in the sidebar
4. Complete the payment form and verify the redirect works
5. Check that your account is upgraded to premium status

## Note
For production use, make sure to:
1. Use a real ngrok URL or domain with HTTPS
2. Use live Razorpay API keys instead of test keys
3. Implement proper security measures for payment verification
